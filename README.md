For this multithreading project I parallelized the Marching Squares algorithm, namely the following steps: rescale image, sample grid and marching squares. First (in main) I read and initialized the necessary data, making allocations where needed (for grid and image). After that I called create() and join() to the threads using *thread_function(void* arg). Within this function, I first checked if image rescaling is needed; if not, I skip the rescale step. If it is, I use bicubic interpolation, with the outer for parallelized, with start and end parameters calculated with the respective formulas and using a barrier for thread synchronization. When building the grid I parallelized all 3 fors (with start and end updated accordingly), and marching squares, the outer forum. At the end I use a single thread to write the result to the file.
